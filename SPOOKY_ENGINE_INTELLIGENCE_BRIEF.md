## 🧮 3. Current Strength Calculation System

### **Components & Weights (47% Total)**
```python
weights = {
    'elo': 0.18,              # 18% - Match-based team strength
    'squad_value': 0.15,      # 15% - Market-based team quality  
    'form': 0.05,             # 5% - Recent performance (last 5 matches)
    'squad_depth': 0.02,      # 2% - Squad size and composition
    'h2h_performance': 0.04,  # 4% - Historical head-to-head
    'scoring_patterns': 0.03  # 3% - Goal-scoring trends
}
# Total: 47% of planned full system
```

### **Competition-Aware Normalization (Key Innovation)**
```python
# Each metric normalized 0-1 within its competition
# Best team in Premier League = 1.0, worst = 0.0
# Best team in Serie A = 1.0, worst = 0.0
# Enables fair cross-league comparison

final_strength = (
    (elo_normalized * 0.18) +
    (squad_value_normalized * 0.15) +
    # ... other normalized components
) * 100  # Convert to percentage (0-47%)
```

### **Output Format**
- **Range**: 0-47% (current system coverage)
- **Precision**: 3 decimal places
- **Storage**: `competition_team_strength.overall_strength`
- **Display**: Real-time web interface with rankings
