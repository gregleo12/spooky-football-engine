## Deployment Progress (Session 2 - July 25, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Deployment Preparation:
1. **Git Repository**: Initialized with comprehensive .gitignore
2. **Production Configuration**:
   - `requirements.txt`: All dependencies including gunicorn, psycopg2-binary
   - `Procfile`: Railway-ready with gunicorn configuration
   - `database_config.py`: Database abstraction supporting SQLite/PostgreSQL
   - `migrate_to_postgresql.py`: Complete migration script ready
   - `demo_app.py`: Modified for production (PORT env var, DATABASE_URL support)
3. **Initial Commit**: All 54 files committed and ready for push

### üìã Deployment Checklist:
- ‚úÖ Initialize git repository and create .gitignore
- ‚è≥ Create GitHub repository 'spooky-football-engine'
- ‚úÖ Create requirements.txt with all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create Procfile for Railway deployment

- ‚è≥ Test production deployment and verify all features

### üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment:
```bash
# Create GitHub repo and push code
gh repo create spooky-football-engine --public --description "Football team strength analysis engine with Flask web interface"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spooky-football-engine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Then deploy to Railway:
# 1. Go to railway.app
# 2. Connect GitHub account
# 3. Deploy from spooky-football-engine repo
# 4. Add PostgreSQL service
# 5. Run migration: python migrate_to_postgresql.py
```
