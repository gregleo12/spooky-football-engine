### Technical Architecture

#### Backend (Python/SQLite)
- **Database**: SQLite with competition-aware schema
- **API Integration**: API-Football for live data
- **Web Scraping**: Transfermarkt for squad values
- **Historical Data**: European competitions and H2H analysis

#### Frontend (Flask/HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Framework**: Flask with Jinja2 templates
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript for dynamic content
- **Mobile**: Responsive design for all devices

#### Data Collection Agents
- **Team Strength Agents** (`agents/team_strength/`): Core metrics
- **Historical Data Agents** (`agents/historical_data/`): H2H and European data ✅ NEW
- **Shared Utilities** (`agents/shared/`): Normalization and utilities

## System Capabilities

### Team Strength Analysis
- **96 Teams**: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1
- **28 International Teams**: Major national teams
- **Competition-Aware**: Normalized within each league context
- **Real Data**: 100% real values from authoritative sources

### Match Analysis Features
- **Same League**: Uses local league strength scores
- **Cross League**: Uses European strength scores
- **International**: Uses international strength scores
- **H2H History**: Real match history from API-Football
- **Upcoming Fixtures**: Next 5 fixtures for each team
- **Form Analysis**: Last 5 games with detailed breakdowns

### Current Hosting
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5001
- **Status**: Running locally, considering PostgreSQL migration for production deployment

## Deployment Progress (Session 2 - July 25, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Deployment Preparation:
1. **Git Repository**: Initialized with comprehensive .gitignore
2. **Production Configuration**:
   - `requirements.txt`: All dependencies including gunicorn, psycopg2-binary
   - `Procfile`: Railway-ready with gunicorn configuration
   - `database_config.py`: Database abstraction supporting SQLite/PostgreSQL
   - `migrate_to_postgresql.py`: Complete migration script ready
   - `demo_app.py`: Modified for production (PORT env var, DATABASE_URL support)
3. **Initial Commit**: All 54 files committed and ready for push

### 📋 Deployment Checklist:
- ✅ Initialize git repository and create .gitignore
- ⏳ Create GitHub repository 'spooky-football-engine'
- ✅ Create requirements.txt with all dependencies
- ✅ Create Procfile for Railway deployment
- ✅ Modify demo_app.py for production configuration
- ⏳ Set up Railway deployment with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Create database migration script
- ⏳ Test production deployment and verify all features

### 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment:
```bash
# Create GitHub repo and push code
gh repo create spooky-football-engine --public --description "Football team strength analysis engine with Flask web interface"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spooky-football-engine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Then deploy to Railway:
# 1. Go to railway.app
# 2. Connect GitHub account
# 3. Deploy from spooky-football-engine repo
# 4. Add PostgreSQL service
# 5. Run migration: python migrate_to_postgresql.py
```

## Future Expansion (53% Remaining)

### Planned Categories
- **Match Context** (20%): Home advantage, match stakes, fatigue
- **Player Availability** (15%): Injuries, international duty, fitness  
- **Market Behavior** (10%): Betting market insights
- **External Factors** (5%): Weather, referee tendencies

### Deployment Considerations
- **Database Migration**: Considering SQLite → PostgreSQL
- **Hosting Platforms**: Render, Railway, DigitalOcean
- **Production Readiness**: All features tested and working
