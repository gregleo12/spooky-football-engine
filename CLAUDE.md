# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a **comprehensive football strength analysis system** with a Flask web application called "Spooky" designed for football prediction games. The system calculates competition-aware team strength scores across Top 5 European leagues plus international teams using 6 core parameters. The web application provides real-time team vs team analysis with European competition integration and interactive features.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 Complete - 47% of full blueprint implemented with live web interface.

## Environment Setup

The project uses a Python virtual environment located at `venv/`. To work with this codebase:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 playwright
```

## Database Architecture

The system uses SQLite with a clean **competition-aware schema**:

### Current Tables (Production)
- `teams`: Team information with UUID primary keys (98 teams across 5 leagues)
- `competitions`: League/competition definitions (8 competitions: 5 domestic + 3 European)
- `competition_team_strength`: **Primary strength data table** with competition-normalized metrics

### Key Files
- `models/setup_db.py`: Database schema creation
- `models/seed_teams.py`: Team data seeding
- `models/create_competition_aware_schema.py`: Competition-aware schema setup
- `db/football_strength.db`: SQLite database file

## Core Components

### Current System Architecture

The system has been **cleaned and organized** into a streamlined structure:

#### Team Strength Agents (`agents/team_strength/`) âœ… PRODUCTION
- `competition_elo_agent.py`: ELO ratings calculated per-competition with fixtures
- `competition_form_agent.py`: Recent form scores (last 5 matches) per-competition  
- `competition_squad_value_agent.py`: Squad market values from Transfermarkt per-competition
- `competition_squad_depth_agent.py`: Squad size analysis per-competition

#### Data Management (`agents/data_collection/`)
- `add_top5_league_teams.py`: Populates teams across all 5 major European leagues

#### Analysis Tools (`agents/analysis/`)
- `competition_summary_report.py`: Comprehensive data coverage and quality report

#### Shared Utilities (`agents/shared/`)
- `competition_normalizer.py`: **KEY UTILITY** - Competition-aware normalization logic
- `team_api_ids.json`: Maps team names to API-Football team IDs
- `debug.py`: Agent debugging utilities

#### Legacy (`agents/legacy/`)
- `player_agent.py`: **ARCHIVED** - Not used in calculations

### Calculation Scripts
- `main.py`: Main strength calculation with weighted scoring system (18% ELO, 15% squad value, 5% form, 2% squad depth)
- `working_main.py`: Detailed calculation script with parameter breakdown for each team
- `debug_main.py`: Database debugging and verification script

### Archive System
All temporary files, validation reports, and legacy scripts are organized in `archive/`:
- `archive/validation_reports/`: Historical validation and credibility reports
- `archive/legacy_scripts/`: Old agents and migration scripts
- `archive/database_backups/`: Database backups before major changes

## API Configuration

The system uses API-Football (v3.football.api-sports.io) with the following configuration:
- API Key: Stored directly in agent files (53faec37f076f995841d30d0f7b2dd9d)
- Leagues: All Top 5 European leagues (Premier League: 39, La Liga: 140, Serie A: 135, Bundesliga: 78, Ligue 1: 61)
- Season: 2024 (current season data)

## Team Strength Parameters (47% of Full Blueprint) âœ… PHASE 2 COMPLETE

The system implements 6 core strength parameters with competition-aware normalization:

### Core Team Strength (40%)
- **ELO Score: 18%** - Match-based team strength (normalized per-competition)
- **Squad Value Score: 15%** - Market-based team quality from Transfermarkt (100% real data coverage)
- **Form Score: 5%** - Recent performance (last 5 matches)
- **Squad Depth Score: 2%** - Squad size and depth measure

### Historical Data Analysis (7%) âœ… NEW IN PHASE 2
- **H2H Performance: 4%** - Head-to-head historical performance analysis
- **Scoring Patterns: 3%** - Goal-scoring trends and defensive patterns

### Competition-Aware Normalization âœ… VALIDATED
**Key Innovation**: Each parameter is normalized within its competition context:
- Values are scaled 0-1 within each league (e.g., best Premier League team = 1.0, worst = 0.0)
- This ensures fair comparison across different competition levels
- Cross-league rankings use raw values, within-league rankings use normalized values

## Data Quality Status âœ… PRODUCTION READY

### Coverage (100% Complete)
- **Teams**: 96/96 teams across 5 leagues
- **ELO Data**: 96/96 teams with real API-Football ratings
- **Squad Values**: 96/96 teams with real Transfermarkt data (no estimates)
- **Form Data**: 96/96 teams with recent match performance
- **Squad Depth**: 96/96 teams with composition analysis

## Session Logging Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: To maintain continuity across Claude Code sessions:

1. **PROJECT_LOG.md**: Session history tracking what was accomplished
2. **CLAUDE_WEB_CONTEXT.md**: Web application status and deployment context
3. **Auto-update**: After significant tasks, proactively update documentation
4. **Three-file system**: 
   - `CLAUDE.md` (this file): Project guidance and current state
   - `PROJECT_LOG.md`: Historical log of work sessions
   - `CLAUDE_WEB_CONTEXT.md`: Web application and deployment status
5. **Archive system**: All temporary files and reports preserved in `archive/`

This ensures continuity across sessions and maintains project history.
