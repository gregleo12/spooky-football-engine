## 📊 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### Dual Scoring Methodology

**1. LOCAL LEAGUE STRENGTH (0-100%)**
- Normalized within each domestic league
- Best team in each league = 100%
- Worst team in each league = 0%
- Shows relative dominance within domestic competition

**2. EUROPEAN STRENGTH (0-100%)**
- Normalized across all 96 teams in Top 5 leagues
- Best team globally = 100%
- Worst team globally = 0%
- Shows absolute strength across all European leagues

### Key Innovation
This dual system allows for both:
- **Domestic predictions:** Using local league strength for within-league matches
- **European competitions:** Using European strength for cross-league matches
